# CNN-Models
## 1. Overview
Implementing common CNN models using Keras. In Keras, there are some common pre-trained CNN models, like VGG, Inception V3. In this project, in addition to implementing some CNN models that have been implemented by Keras, we will also try to reproduce some of the latest models from the paper.

## Installation
`pip install requirements.txt`

## Project Architecture
Each model is a separate Python package. For the scalability of the model, the model implementation uses the functional API.
